I used to Online Generator at the following address:

http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/software/LUgen/

Step 1: Enter the size you want and the corresponding Matrix block size. I used the same value for both.

Step 1.5: If you are creating something greater than 128, you will need to do 2 things:
		1. open wfifo.v and change the parameter FIFOOUTPUTWIDTH to a value that is = FIFOINPUTWIDTH/32.
		2. open rfifo.v and change the parameter FIFOINPUTWIDTH to a value that is = FIFOOUTPUTWIDTH/32.

Step 2: open LU_template.v located in this folder, and the top_level file located in the generated code. This file should be called LU<size>PEEng.v (for example, LU64PEEng.v). 

Step 3: Copy the code of the parameter values from the generated file into the template and change the name of the top module as desired. 

Step 4: Replace the gerenated file with the newly created code from the template.

Step 4: Include the following files in the project, essentially every .v file except alt_mem_phy_defines.v and any file that starts with ddr2:
addr_fifo.v
DataTransferUnit.v
divsp.v
LU.v
LU<size>PEENG.v (eg LU64PEEng.v)
LUControl.v
MarsharllerController.v
memcmd_fifo.v
mult_add.v
multsplat11.v
ram.v
rfifo.v
subsplat14.v
top_ram.v
wfifo.v
